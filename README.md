# IlluminateWebBrowser
Here, you can obtain a copy of Illuminate, a basic HTML only web browser that has absolutely NO tracking. This is only for Windows, and may not work properly with every site. It's also important to note that this is a browser- NOT a search engine. It still requires the use of Google or Bing, which can be set in its Settings.
